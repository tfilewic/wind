# Wind and Route Visualization

Trying to learn some frontend with React, Leaflet.js, JavaScript, and API Integration.

## Project will:
- [X] Display a map with Esri satellite imagery
- [X] Display a .gpx route 
- [ ] Fetch routes from Strava API
- [ ] Display wind direction and magnitude along the route
- [ ] Fetch wind data from OpenWeatherMap
- [ ] Implement a backend proxy to handle API requests

## Technologies Used
- **React** – frontend framework for building the UI  
- **Leaflet.js** – mapping library for displaying routes and wind data  
- **Esri Satellite Imagery** – basemap  
- **@tmcw/togeojson** – converts .gpx files to GeoJSON  
- **GeoJSON** – data format for geographic information  
- **Strava API** – to fetch user .gpx routes  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – to fetch wind data
