# **Wind and Route Visualization**

Trying to learn some frontend with React, Leaflet.js, JavaScript, and API Integration.

Project will:
[X] Display a map with Esri satellite imagery
[] Display a .gpx route 
[] Fetch routes from Strava API
[] Display wind direction and magnitude along the route
[] Fetch wind data from OpenWeatherMap
